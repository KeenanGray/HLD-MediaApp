For me on display is really an exercise in mental strength. When I'm still, I think, I can't be still, I can't be still any longer, how long has it been, I don't know if I can do this any longer. And then I just push, I just push a little bit more and just push through the next 5 seconds, the next 10 seconds, the next 15 seconds. And eventually I get to the end of the performance and I'm always so impressed with myself. It's funny, because I'm a dancer and I push my body to do really crazy hard things, but staying still is so incredibly hard and so mentally challenging. You think, "oh this hurts", "oh I need to scratch this". There's just so many thoughts that come up, and knowing that I can push through that is actually really exciting, and makes me feel really strong.
