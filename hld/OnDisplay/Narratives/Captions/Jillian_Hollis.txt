Being on display, viewed by the world I feel very seen but unseen at the same time. People often just see one side of you, or make judgments on… what they see based on just your appearance; and they know nothing really… what is going on in your mind, or who you are, or what you've been through. And… you can't get that just from a first glance or just being in someone's presence for a day or in a passing judgment is cruel… Being on display in – in performance, I feel very powerful, vulnerable and raw, but at the same time I feel strong, and confident in my choice to be viewed. Being on display in performance is something that we've rehearsed very hard for; and I want people to see all of us, in all of our glory, in all of our struggles in… the work that we're putting out in the world. And I want them to take it in, and make their own judgments about it, and have their own experience with us. Being on display in just a general performance, I feel… (pause) a number of different feelings; because I do all different kinds of performances; and I feel sexy, I feel strong, I feel confident in all my training as a dancer, but sometimes not. I’m full of contradictions; I'm always talking to myself in my head, I strive for perfection but I know perfection is unattainable, and I just try and be present in the moment; and take and what is happening around me, as well what is happening in myself and in my mind.
