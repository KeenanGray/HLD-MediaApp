I have been disabled since 1997 but I didn't use a wheelchair until 2004… and it's really interesting how people view me and I do kind of feel every day that I'm out that I am on display, I can't help it. The wheelchair speaks volumes. It took me awhile to feel comfortable being displayed or viewed in performance but now I really feel proud about it I feel like I'm really showing who I am and what I am in whatever body it is that I have to offer.  Um… since I was once a quote unquote able bodied dancer, and now as a dancer/performer in a wheelchair it's taken me some time to feel comfortable displaying myself in my wheelchair, being viewed in my wheelchair and accepted still as a dancer… so I feel like I've come a really long way doing this project because now I feel proud of who I am.
