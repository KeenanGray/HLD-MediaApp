To me being on displayed means to be visible in the public eye, being a member of the LGBTQI+ community, being BIPOC, sometimes I'm on display in a way that is othering. That is violent, puts me in danger because I don't fit into someone's box or comfort level about how they want the world to be or who they want me to be. And especially I think for people with mental health issues and who are disabled our society isn't always built for people who are mentally ill, people who are disabled, people who are of color, people who are LGBTQI+. And living in New York, we're in the public sphere, we're in the public eye. There's millions of people walking around every day on the street, on the subway. So to have agency over your body, can be on displayed in a positive way, but when society doesn't allow you to have that agency, or you are being singled out because you're different. That can be being on displayed as well. And being violent and dangerous. But when I have agency and I'm turning a look honey, and I'm being celebrated for who I am, or just being able to exist. Being on display in that way can be liberating.
