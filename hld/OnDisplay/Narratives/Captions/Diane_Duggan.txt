I invite you to look at me, what do you see? Do you see the bulging veins and liver spots of my 76 years?
My thinning hair, the crepe of my skin. The droop of my neck. Go ahead, I've contemplated them myself. On good days, they are simply the price of survival, of continuing to live. On bad days, I cringe as I blur my vision to fade them out. When I just feel, without looking, I feel good in my body. I'm healthy, I feel loved. I feel connected and valued. Do you see that? Do you see my spirit, the internal resources that support me as I stand before you? Do you see who I am? What I'm thinking? What I'm feeling? I invite you to look. What you see is not just me, it's you as well. It's what my physical presence before you, calls up from within you. The meaning you ascribe to me. Go ahead and look, what you see is part of who I am given meaning by part of who you are. Go ahead and look, what you see is me, what you see is you.
