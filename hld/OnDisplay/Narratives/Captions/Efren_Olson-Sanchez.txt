I always considered myself as an introverted person so I think that's why I put myself under those situations of being just...there. Present with my body. I use this time to dig inside of myself. My deepest thoughts. It's a very cathartic moment but also I feel very vulnerable when I'm there because I'm exposed. And uh, and I feel fragile, and I feel that anyone can iterate everything around me at any moment. So it's a very interesting thing to experience now that I am thinking about it. It's playing with these two sides of the same thing, introspection and vulnerability at the same time. Huh, never thought about that.
