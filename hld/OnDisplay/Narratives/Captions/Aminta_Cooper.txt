You look at me and all you see is the shade of my skin
not who I be. 
But when I'm on stage to perform, suddenly I'm part of the norm. 
We connect in such a way that it seems like any normal day. 
But when the show is over and the sun goes down and the sky is dark 
you no longer feel what's in my heart. 
So as I move from position to position there's just one thing I feel I should mention.
 The arts is how I try to get your attention 
 to the fact that we are one.
