On display viewed in the world. It means a lot to me because it means representation for people that don't always have the voice or the assessability to um, to be represented in mainstream society. So I think it's very important that, um, on display is used as a resource for those to have that type of accessibility of for representation on display and performance is such a beautiful collaboration of all of the installations of on display being timestamped on display in displayed. I feel that it is a great montage of all of the work and all of the hard labor and all of the beautiful collaborations that have taken place over the course of a three year time span and how powerful actual representation of disabled bodies and nondisabled bodies and people of different nationalities coming together in producing this beautiful work and just being a part of something that is, uh, exposed and vulnerable and real on display. Being actually in this piece feels very surreal each time because the piece takes on a different life form and I get to explore and find something new each time I performed this stance, which is really inspiring and very fun.
