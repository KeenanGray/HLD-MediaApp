On Display for me, it really defines the essence of being a human. Of what it means to be a human, with all of its flaws and scars. It's like looking in a mirror and seeing oneself. To truly see oneself of who you are as individual, and how you see yourself in society. I think On Display, it gives a sense of layering in a way. We're going through different layers and we're trying to get to the deepest part of one's soul I guess I can say. So really trying to have people to have a deeper sense of who they are humans in this society.
