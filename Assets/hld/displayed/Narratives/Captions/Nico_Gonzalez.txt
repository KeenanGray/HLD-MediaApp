Being on display in the world means trying not to take up too much space. Making sure people don't think I'm more important than I am. Trying not to get in people's way. Trying to… minimize what people can use against me. Making sure that no one thinks I  mean them any harm or misunderstands my intention. Making sure that I'm as kind as possible as often as possible. Making sure that… I am not misunderstood. Being on display in performance means exposing the parts of myself that I'm afraid of. Being strong. Invulnerability. Listening to the moment and responding without hesitation. Being present with my company, and giving my best self. Understanding that even if I feel exposed or uncomfortable that might be what the moment needs. And (pause) not letting my own insecurities and questions about myself get in the way of offering all I have. It means interrupting my own expectations. And seeing what happens from there. Being on display in this piece means finding a way to keep the fire going in complete stillness completely losing myself in movement and giving into every impulse. Letting myself feel out of control and knowing that I will find my way out. Reaching beyond what I think people want to see and finding my edges. Reflecting back what I see in others, what inspires me. What triggers me what sets me off. Leaving what I think people want to see behind, embracing what I see is my weaknesses and flaws. As beautiful things to share.
