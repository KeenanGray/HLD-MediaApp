How do you feel being on display viewed in the world? In general I feel a pressure to be put together. To be aesthetically… enough, whatever enough is. I feel myself struggling to accept my own imperfections, but in moments of light accepting of them and my individuality um… from what society sort of imposes on females especially. I feel that I need to fit a certain body type. And that I don't have this perfect petite hourglass body type. And I notice it permeates my decisions and affects my self-esteem. But when I can overcome these societal pressures I in the end am actually quite happy with myself and my shape. How do you feel being on display viewed in performance? When I'm performing and I have individuals in the audience whom I know and anyone that I've invited, I tend to worry about their expectations and what they think of what I do. If what I'm doing is exciting enough or boring to them. Or different than what they had thought. But while on stage while in performance I feel alert and alive. And… most of all I feel purposeful like I'm part of something that truly has meaning, and positive effect on others. How do you feel being on display viewed in this piece? In this piece I feel connected to not only the cast, but to something greater than myself. I feel that I'm part of a larger purpose and mission. And that I am in a place of importance and beauty. And I also feel that while performing this piece. That we really all are one, and part of the same essence, and that we are equally divine.
