When I think of being on display, themes of vulnerability, and intimacy, and revealing, come to mind. When I'm being observed by an audience, whatever that is, it could be from a number of different lenses. Could be of celebration, criticism, learning, but that sense of being exposed or revealing is inherently there. Whenever there is a moment of being on display or this feeling of being on display it creates a space to share a message or provoke a thought, or build a relationship or dialogue between the thing or person being on display and the thing or person observing. I think the most potent instances of being on display have been where there has been a lasting thought or lasting image or lasting motion that has been left with the audience and that they can carry into the future.
