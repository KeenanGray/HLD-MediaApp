Now I'm in the Bleeker street subway station waiting for the train to come. Actually when thinking about the question "what does it mean to be viewed or on display in the world", I will think of subway. Subway is the situation that comes to my mind first. I feel on the platform or on the train, the space itself almost it is designed for people to look at each other. When we have nothing to do we can either look at our phones maybe to avoid eye contact to avoid looking at each other or we might actually take a look. Actually I think that's one of the reason why I like to take the subway, because I enjoy looking at people I also enjoy people's looks. Why enjoy looking at people why enjoy being looked at? Actually sometimes I would just take long walks on the street without having to do anything just to look at people. Because I'm curious about people. I want to know more about people. And what is interesting about looking instead of being engaged in a conversation is that you don't have to embarrass yourself for others.  You don't have to create pressure of talking to someone. Because everyday in the subway in all the public spaces, there's this natural opportunity given to us that we can look at each other. The way we are dressed the way we dress ourselves. I also like seeing how other people interact with other people. They way they talk to each other when they are in conversation. I don't need to really be there and to be part of the conversation but to be an observer it is very interesting. Like you are a part of other people's lives at the same time we are not really in their life.  As for being view when being on display for performance. I enjoy being looked at. That is initially why I I want to be a performer. Just like I just said that why I enjoy looking at people why enjoyed being looked at in public spaces because I want to expose myself to others. I want this communication without words. Through my performance sometimes I feel I can even say more. With even more accuracy with more depth than direct verbal conversation. Because we somehow divided or we have this barrier of language each of us. Even if we speak the same language our own way of speaking can be different. And I think that's why we can misunderstand each other. But I think that in art we're speaking a universal language. And that's what makes being on display in performance meaningful to me. I remember one time when I was just dancing or performing it was just for practicing having fun. At the park I was at Washington Square park. A another girl, a female dancer, she was dancing. In the same park, in a corner. She was obviously a trained dancer. And after we danced separately for maybe 15 or 20 minutes I finally joined her. And afterwards we talked a little bit about dance, about performance. Some of the things that she said this are actually  still you show importance to me. She said that for her is the key to live performances vulnerability. I think this concept really speaks to my answer to this question. Vulnerability is to expose yourself. Because if you don't want to expose yourself, then there is really not point in performing. But if you're willing to be vulnerable and you use your techniques that way. You use techniques not to hide yourself behind those techniques but to actually convey the most of vulnerable part of yourself. Then I think that's what makes performance. For this specific piece DISPLAYED I think it's different from like me dancing on my own or my other performances in many ways because it's more like a group performance. I think it is not just about vulnerability or self expression. There is also other elements such as to come collaborate and create cohesiveness. Consistency and unity among this whole group. And I think this is maybe my biggest challenge is being part of this performance.
