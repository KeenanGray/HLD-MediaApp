As someone who's been very visibly physically disabled since childhood. I've never had much choice about being on display… out in the world. Um when I was younger, in my twenties I guess, I enjoyed playing with that, and kind of exploiting the tension between um the ways I was objectified for conforming to certain ideals of femininity and beauty and um the ways that I Could be read as kind of freakish or monstrous I guess. Um Now I'm over 40 and um as with most women I am afforded a greater deal of anonymity. How I feel about being on display in performance varies depending on the audience the venue what's going on in my own life and how I feel in my own body on any given day. As a general rule I enjoy performing. It is empowering for me to feel that I am in control of the construction of my own physical presence. That said there um (slight laughter) there are times when being on display feels very raw. And there are times, recently there’ve been, a few times when I've felt highly visible but that I remain fundamentally unseen. That I'm just conforming to what other people's ideas of my narrative are. I experience each "On Display" installation as distinct and unique. Sometimes I have felt that my own performance has been transformative for myself, and for my audience. But let me say this if what you take from my personal performance is a sense of being uplifted above imperfection or transcending limitations… then I am not doing my job I have not done my job. Because what I seek to convey is openness is vulnerability and authenticity. But it's also a nuanced portrait of what it means for me to exist in my body; what it has meant for me to exist in my body. And my own strength.
