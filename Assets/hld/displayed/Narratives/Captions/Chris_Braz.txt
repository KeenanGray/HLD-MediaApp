The truth is I'm a very self conscious person. Like anyone I have a lot of self doubts. I'm used to being stared at in my personal life. Usually it's in a sexual nature. Since I was about sixteen I've been hit on by older adult men. They normally think prostitute or a street hustler. Especially when I travel to other countries. I guess being queer and brown skinned people think they have access to your body. When I was younger, it freaked me out. I think now in my late 20s I've learned to embrace it, take back some power. I'm still working on it. Some days I don't feel like being on displayed. It feels like a contradiction. Sometimes I'm very angry at audience members because they remind me of my sixteen year old self and the things I've buried. I don't like to open myself up to people because I've been in an abusive relationship with an older man and I don't trust easy.  So "On Display" for me is a battle, because I'm being asked to expose completely vulnerable parts of myself. And it scares me because if people knew how angry, sad, and tired I am would they like me. I want them to like me, I want to be liked. But I am also tired and I don't care sometimes. Everyone is going to think I'm, but I don't know what to smile about. I don't know maybe I am angry, but that's okay too.
