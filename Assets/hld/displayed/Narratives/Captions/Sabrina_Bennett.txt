On Display in my eyes was a vulnerability that in the past thirty-seven years of my life I wouldn't allow anybody to penetrate my walls. Until I did On Display. Since I've been injured for the past twelve years of my life I've always had a headstrong mind to withstand and endure along with survive no matter what. I was always praised on my beauty like I should have been locked up in a wall full of China to be glimpsed at in amazement. To have viewers look at me to say that "I am too pretty to be in a wheelchair" which always made me feel uncomfortable. To the fact that my chair was my personal space that no one could penetrate, I would never allow it. But working with Heidi allowed me to break down those walls. To say that it was okay. It allowed me to accept individuals to see me, understand me, feel my energy, and just to take a glimpse of my vulnerability and who I am as an individual.
