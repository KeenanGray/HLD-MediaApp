People look at me and make assumptions. It's what we all do whether we admit it or not. In my life I can't check just one box, I usually check "other". Or in some cases I just end up checking several boxes - even if the rules say not to. I have cerebral palsy. At times I walk with crutches, at times I don't and I use a wheelchair. I find people approach me differently when they see me, based on how I’m moving throughout my day. I've had people not realize I was disabled when I sitting at a table. And as soon as I stand up they like freak out, or have that "Aha!" moment, like "that's what was wrong with him." What will you see? What will you choose to see? Will you see someone who's mixed race? Will you see an Asian person? Will you see a white man?  An Asian man? A wheelchair, or a wheelchair user? Learning to understand… and accept that there are many different identities that are going to make me who I am, has been a difficult journey. However, it has made me the person I am today. It has brought me in many different directions. It has taught me to see difference in the world. It has taught me to see the difference that is often overlooked or purposely ignored. The beauty of this piece is that's what it is, it's about difference. This piece allows me to show all sides of what makes me… Even if maybe you won't see it, maybe someone next to you will see something different. Who knows?
