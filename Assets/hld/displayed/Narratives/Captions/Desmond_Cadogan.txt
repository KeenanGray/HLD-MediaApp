When I'm on display I feel emotional, I feel strong, and vulnerable. I am balanced and capable I am disciplined and feel free within the rules of the piece I generally feel safe inside myself in the meditative trance. My hisotry has prepared me to perform dynamically, on any given day, in any given performance. The venues contribute considerably to my energy. Sometimes performances of On Display take place in public spaces. Which adds an amount of anxiety and caution. This is when I feel most connected to fellow performers.
