Being on display viewed by the world I feel very seen but unseen at the same time. People often just see one side of you, or make judgments on what they see based on just your appearance and they know nothing really about what is going on in your mind or who you are or what you've been through. And you can't get that just from a first glance or just being in someone's presence for a day or in a passing judgment is cruel. Being on display in performance, I feel very powerful. Vulnerable and raw. But at the same time I feel strong and confident in my choice to be viewed. Being on display in performance is something that we've rehearsed very hard for and I want people to see all of us and all of our glory and all of our struggles in the work that we're putting out in the world. And I want them to take it in and make their own judgments about it and have their own experience with us. Being on display and just a general performance, I feel a number of different feelings because I do all different kinds of performances and I feel sexy I feel strong I feel confident in all my training as a dancer but sometimes not. Full of contradictions I'm always talking to myself in my head I strive for perfection but I know perfection is unattainable and I just try to be present in the moments ands take and what is happening around me as well what is happening in myself and in my mind.
