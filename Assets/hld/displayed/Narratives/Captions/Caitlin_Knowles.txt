When I think of On Display. I think of visibility and feeling seen. There are so many intersections of my identity, my sexuality, my gender, and my disabilities, that really feel taboo or off limits to the general public and I think a lot of people feel uncomfortable with the idea of being on display, but I love the idea of being able to be seen for who I actually am and what I experience rather than submitting to the social pressure to perform what's expected of me.
