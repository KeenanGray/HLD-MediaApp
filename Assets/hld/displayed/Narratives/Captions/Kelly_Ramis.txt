I feel on display all the time. It's not something that you can just turn off. Being mixed race makes me feel like I've always got someone looking at me. People look at me and I can see them asked themselves is she white is she Asian what is she. And silently I asked them back why does it even matter. Performing in this work allows me to fully express myself and not just through my appearance. When I perform I feel like I can open my soul out to the strangers around me and surprisingly it feels really great and really safe.
