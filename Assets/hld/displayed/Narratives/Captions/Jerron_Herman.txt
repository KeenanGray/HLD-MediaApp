I'm observant… actually, I'm really observant; I can tell when you've gotten a haircut, and if you're wearing something new, or… you know, even emotionally I can sense a shift in your… mood. Um and so… I've always prized myself on, or prided myself on knowing and seeing, and so I guess I've always expected a reciprocity from the viewer; To give me the same. [Deep inhale] And I think in performance it's incredible that you can be very close to your counterpoint. Um, “us versus the world” if you will. And yet, you feel incredibly empowered because, they defer to you for everything that you're doing. They defer to you for - for taste, and for uh… intention and sophistication. They defer to you uh… for what is beautiful and I guess in turn the performer is looking at the audience member with a sort of ,um, deferment of taste… and of culture and of reading. So, we have a lot in common that we want from each other. And I think it's - it's this really awesome power play, and kind of like a game of chicken. Who's going to blink first?
