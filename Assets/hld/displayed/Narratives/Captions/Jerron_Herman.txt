I've always dealth with being seen and noticed. Even that word "dealt with" connotes this passive even maybe angered approach to what I view as reality. To have to suffer through another pair of eyes or another pair of perceptions. And then it kind of shifted. I was always challenged by someone prejudiced to talk to them, give them a sense of difference. Those first few words that I began to take ground. I'm seen, they think one way and I talkt to them and that was really effective from the start. So now what does it mean when I'm dancing. No one had expections except a small grup of people. I think that I'm part of their legacy. They saw something in me that I didn't know was there and so we capitalized on it. I talk about my crazy arabesques. It's kind of like my signature - you know me by my arabesques and that's kind of exciting. They're like my ancestors, there like my forerrunners and they dind't have to be black or male to get it. And so when I'm performing there's this through line, this inheritance, this stake in almost a century's worth of modern dance. I feel incredibly tied to them and I feel like I'm making a future. You know a dancer can be a voyuer too. This has been the first piece where I've been given a chance to, out of the corner of my eye, see how Gillian turns or how Meredith leaps or how Chris does what he does. Or even how the scultpures are still. There was this one time I was looking at a monitor - in the wings of one of the  theatres, and was kind of caught off guard and  my breath caught because I saw the composition that I wasn't even a part of at the direct moment but that I was helping to make. It was wild to think that you move through your choreography, your individual journey, and then notice what you're part of, this mosaic, this multi-pronged, multi-entry piece of art. It was a real reminder.
