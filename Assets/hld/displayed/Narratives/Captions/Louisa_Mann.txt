I remember the first major installation we had of ON DISPLAY in 2015. It was at the Lincoln Center Atrium. My costume was this really gorgeous, form-fitting, white mesh dress that was made just for me. It had one long sleeve and one arm exposed. I felt like a total badass in that dress. that performance was really transformative for me. Even though I've been dancing since I was 3, I've kind of always felt very fortunate to feel accespted and I've never really felt held back because of my disablity. Taking part in that performance gave me new ownership and a new sense of confidence in my body. Something that I didn't even necessarily know was missing but something that was so important. I didn't feel like I needed tohide any part of myself, I could just be. Being on display, both in performance and in general is about finding that piece in you that is not afraid to be seen, and being able to be both vulnerable and strong. It's not always easy. A lot of the time it's really really hard. But when you find it, it's freeing.
