Being on display in the world when you have a disability like myself is not something that is fun. People stare, people laugh, people take pictures, people will record you. That is the way the world is right now and it is not fun. But, I ignore that to an extent. Now what I don't like is when people do the cross over their body when they see me as if they are blessed and I'm not. Which is really stressful and it angers me very much. Another reaction I'll get is when people jump in fear because I've suddenly scared them just because I took them by surprise. Which is also not a very good feeling either. But I can't do anything to change that. That is the way it is. Being on display in the peace was something that I really hated. And for the sculpture court section which is the very beginning, I'm still not a fan of it. It is very uncomfortable but I can deal with it. It's not as bad as it was initially my feeling. Because there's a movement involved in the sculpture court I don't feel so uncomfortable. Although I'm not going to lie when there are people like really in front of you. I can hear what they're saying if they're talking and you know sometimes the comments are not really good but for the most part the comments have been very very nice and very good and so I've come to be more accepting of piece.
