How do I feel about being on display or viewed in the world; I feel bold, I feel confident, I feel dorky, I feel vulnerable, I feel decisive, I feel indecisive. I feel that I want to try to live the quote that I saw on the side of a church earlier this year. Which was, "Everyone you come across is dealing with something you know nothing about be kind. I tread lightly." How do I feel being on display viewed in performance; I often feel that a person whether a friend or a stranger can't even begin to know me unless they've seen me in performance. I am my most generous self in performance or when I'm with my child. How do I feel being on display or viewed in this piece; I am most interested in excavating, highlighting, illuminating, discovering, revealing the in between moments like frames in a film or the shots on a contact sheet for a photographer. The moments in between the unresolved instances. The accidents, the shades of gray. I… think that those are the moments that are the most ripe for connection. When I go to a museum… or see art  whether it's in a formal or informal context. The art that resonates the most deeply with me doesn't necessarily fit a classical model of perfection. And I'm very interested in the beauty and the break down. And I love that I have the power and the privilege to be able to explore that for myself. And perhaps demonstrate a moment where someone else from a totally different walk of life might see something familiar in what I'm doing And feel a connection.
