A few years ago I performed in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum. A group of other dancers and I were wearing white unitards and we danced and stood in a gallery space as audience members walked in and out, stopped to watch us, and look at the art around us for about four hours each performance. I had never felt so on display. As we stood there in our white unitards about a foot away from audience members I could feel their eyes staring at every part of my body. It made me think a lot about what it means to be watched and to watch. I wondered who these people were who came to the museum. Why they were there, where they were going after that and how their perception and their story influenced  what they saw in us.
