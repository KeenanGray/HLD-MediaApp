My name is Garrison Redd. I'm from Brooklyn, New York, and I'm a Heidi Latsky On Display performer. On display means a lot to me. It gives me an opportunity to be in touched with my inner self. I like being on display, because I get to find balance. Typically I'm a team USA para-power lifter, and a lot of times I have to showcase strength in my daily day activities. However, with On Display, it gives me that opportunity to just relax and feel what I'm feeling on the inside. I really like On Display. Um in my life it has provided me with tons of extraordinary experiences. One of the experiences is that I am able to calm myself due to the different types of breathing exercises, and also due to the fact that a lot of times I'm in a meditative state where I'm blocking out the outside world.
