Judy:               ... there's temperature, there's people, there's sounds, there's my inner life, and the inner impulse to move. And all of that is happening to me, and in me during on display. And i'm living that and doing my best to remember the tasks at hand, and to stay fully immersed in that experience, which requires of me a uh kind of loss of control at the same time that I'm navigating, which is a kind of control. That kind of paradox is very exciting and it's very liberating. Um Being in on display has - has changed me um being in it as well as being part of - part of the mission, and uh also being in my self in this really deep way, that the more time I spend there, the more carry - carries over into my life. For example, aside from uh - from just a general deeper sense of knowing myself and feeling authentic, I've noticed I am more aware of the way I am perceived as an older person, as a woman in the world, on the street. I navigate that with much more presence um... and more compassion to the people who don't see me, but also a willingness to take up the space that I... take up.
