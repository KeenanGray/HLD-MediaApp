I just got out of the pool and the locker room at the Y. So now, since my February surgery, I don't have an implant in place of my right breast. I cover up with a small towel I carry, and to be honest I check out everyone else's, all the other women's anatomy. Everyone else has two - big, small, old, young, and it's a sexual organ, let's face it. I have one, and a scar. The human eye loves symmetry and my right side is mutilated, and I feel diminished like an outcast, embarrassed, angry. If you ask me how I feel, I feel horrible. That's not an elegant word, but horrible is how I feel. I feel I don't have the right to be equal. I'm grateful beyond saying to be alive, to be able to walk, swim, to be able to do all my daily activities. In a way, I never think about, except that I do cover up. But, it does affect every waking minute. How I feel about who, who I am, that very "un pc" word. I feel like a freak. I'm terrified some kid will look at my chest and shriek, or someone will turn away or gasp, or be disturbed, it's very disturbing. To me and to anyone who glances my way when I'm naked. How do I feel, I feel unequal. Less. Ugly.
