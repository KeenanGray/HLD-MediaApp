Speaker 1:          Everybody always wants to put us into a box, they want to label us. They say, what are you? What do you do? I've never been a person who wanted to be labeled my whole life. Whether I was gay, straight, or bisexual. Whether I was a dancer, a singer, an actor, a model, a jock, I never wanted to have a label on myself. I didn't think I needed one because I was good, I could add a lot of things, I could do a lot of things...

Speaker 1:          But When I got injured... suddenly my body... Didn't look the same. It didn't do the same things. It didn't feel the same things. I never wanted a label so bad. I was searching for that label. And I was searching for the labels to find out what was wrong with me, what I couldn't do, why I couldn't do it....

Speaker 1:          I think by searching for that - that label, I realized I was "dis-labled", I was disabled. But it didn't change who I was. I could still do the same things. Still kind of look the same things, my body was much different... I could feel the same things, but I was still me and that was what was important. And I realized that... by doing the things that I could do and showing the things that I could do, being on display, that other people might see those things. And when somebody who might not be able to do the things or can't imagine that they could do those things, that I might be able to do, or the way that I might be able to do it or show it... give them the courage to try.
