When I'm on display, the first thing I'm thinking about is my body and its contact with the ground, which toe, in which placement, if I can form architectural forms under my feet in order to support my weight? What's the texture of the floor? How can I drop through my bones? What muscles can I release? What impulse do I need to follow next? But then, I also think about sculptures I've seen in museums around the world. I think about Renaissance art a lot, the S curve in Da Vinci's works of David. And um... I also think about the languid postures that you see of sculptures of saints, the open mouths, the kind of surrender that they have, and that becomes part of the meditation of surrendering into the posture.
One of the experiences I have around being on display is that it challenges my own acceptance of my own body, especially since I think of myself as younger and maybe less fuller than I currently am as a mom, and this body of somebody whose had two kids. It can be really challenging to look at myself without make-up, without earrings, without um the kind of modest clothing I more often wear, and um that flies in the face of my belief systems about how we should see other people, that everybody should be beautiful, that everybody should be acceptable, or interesting. I think I still don't give myself that much leeway when I'm getting in costume for one of these installations.
