Being on display allows me to present myself as I want when I want. Normally people see me how they want or expect. As a wheelchair user I think many people see me as weak or incapable based on their assumptions. Just rolling down the block, people try to help push my chair and often think that I'm struggling. Some have been surprised that I have a full time job, or even live on my own and then I'm called an inspiration for doing things that everyone else does every day. I'm honestly just trying to exist and survive like anyone else. If I need to adapt to overcome a world that wasn't made with me in mind, that is what I'm going to do. When I put myself on display I'm showing my strongest self.
