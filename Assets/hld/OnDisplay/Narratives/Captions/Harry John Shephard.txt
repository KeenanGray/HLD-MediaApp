HJ:                 Being on display.

HJ:                 (quietly) being on display, Being on display, being on display is thrilling and terrifying. It is. It feels dangerous and it feels foreign and it feels like too much. Um I don't want to be seen... And yet... I like to dance. I want to be invisible and yet I - I enjoy performing and I choose to do it. Um I think this is really ... I don't think this is an unusual tension for people in the performing arts to have.

HJ:                 You know what, let me just speak for myself. I don't want to be seen because depending on where I am from one day to another, I still see my body not as something that I am one with, but as this thing that I'm shackled to and that is my enemy. Um and I am very much farther along in my recovery from disordered eating than I was just a couple of years ago but I... have a long history of choosing to disengage from life because it wasn't safe or it didn't feel safe.

HJ:                 Being on display in this project... Offers me the choice, which is to really try to discern and be honest with myself about when it is simply uncomfortable to be on display as opposed to it actually being unsafe for me to be on display and that is a painful line of inquiry but it is essential if I want to stay engaged with life and it is essential if I want to keep making art and be happy.
