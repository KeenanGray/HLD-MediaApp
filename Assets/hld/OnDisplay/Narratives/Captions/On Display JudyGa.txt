Speaker 1:          It can be exhausting and lonely... To feel that I have to present myself to the world in a way that is acceptable to others. And participating in on display has given me permission to... Practice being authentic under the gaze of strangers. And being part of a group of people who are all willing to do that, and that's been life changing. And it was scary, and is still sometimes scary to be that vulnerable, to have my eyes closed and to know that people are looking at me. Um I come from the the world of classical ballet and, where beauty has a certain meaning and presenting oneself in a certain way is needed, and uh you're always controlling the angle and whatever at which you're being seen. And on display is the exact opposite of that.

Speaker 1:          And while it can feel scary, what I've learned by doing it is that there's actually an enormous amount of safety in going deeply into myself and being myself, my 64 year old wrinkled, crepey skin, bags under my eyes, saggy boobed, wrinkly knees, bla - brown-spotted self. um And there's actually comfort in the gaze of others. I can settle into it. I can actually enjoy following what I feel... In the presence of others, and that is a huge... experience and it has changed me. I feel very grateful for that.
