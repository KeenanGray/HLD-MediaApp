Hi there. I am Katherine. As you can see, I have a physical disability and I look very different to the rest of the people. And sometimes you know, being different can be a good thing or a bad thing. And the bad thing about being different is that in my daily life I just deal with people that look at me a little weird for being different. And sometimes that makes me feel uncomfortable and sometimes I even wish I was invisible because I don't like how their looks make me feel. But, you know what, here on display it's different because I am the one who chooses to be observed. I choose what to show you, and how vulnerable to be with you and when I am here, sitting still, I feel like a piece of art in a museum. Feeling the observation of the visitors and absorbing all the good energies that pass near me. So my final wish is that the next time you see someone who looks different, or maybe that looks like me, you can see them with noble and not judgemental eyes. And please don't be afraid of the people that look different from you. Remember being different is beautiful and exciting.
