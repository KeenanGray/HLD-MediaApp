Jessica:            I was hesitant to put myself on display because it would just be an extension of my daily life as a wheelchair user. Everyone always stares and thinks I'm helpless. For whatever reason, I was given a life that constantly frustrates me and makes me feel like a second class citizen , but in recent years, I've adopted the mentality that I am stronger than my disability. I've gone above and beyond to prove to myself and everyone around me that nothing will stop me. I am putting myself on display for everyone to see.
