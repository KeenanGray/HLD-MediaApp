It can be exhausting and lonely... To feel that I have to present myself to the world in a way that is acceptable to others. And participating in on display has given me permission to... Practice being authentic under the gaze of strangers. And being part of a group of people who are all willing to do that, and that's been life changing. And it was scary, and is still sometimes scary to be that vulnerable, to have my eyes closed and to know that people are looking at me. Um I come from the the world of classical ballet and, where beauty has a certain meaning and presenting oneself in a certain way is needed, and uh you're always controlling the angle and whatever at which you're being seen. And on display is the exact opposite of that.
And while it can feel scary, what I've learned by doing it is that there's actually an enormous amount of safety in going deeply into myself and being myself, my 64 year old wrinkled, crepey skin, bags under my eyes, saggy boobed, wrinkly knees, bla - brown-spotted self. um And there's actually comfort in the gaze of others. I can settle into it. I can actually enjoy following what I feel... In the presence of others, and that is a huge... experience and it has changed me. I feel very grateful for that.
Judy:               ... there's temperature, there's people, there's sounds, there's my inner life, and the inner impulse to move. And all of that is happening to me, and in me during on display. And i'm living that and doing my best to remember the tasks at hand, and to stay fully immersed in that experience, which requires of me a uh kind of loss of control at the same time that I'm navigating, which is a kind of control. That kind of paradox is very exciting and it's very liberating. Um Being in on display has - has changed me um being in it as well as being part of - part of the mission, and uh also being in my self in this really deep way, that the more time I spend there, the more carry - carries over into my life. For example, aside from uh - from just a general deeper sense of knowing myself and feeling authentic, I've noticed I am more aware of the way I am perceived as an older person, as a woman in the world, on the street. I navigate that with much more presence um... and more compassion to the people who don't see me, but also a willingness to take up the space that I... take up.
